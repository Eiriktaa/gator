# Gator CLI
My solution to [https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-blog-aggregator-golang](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-blog-aggregator-golang)


A command-line tool built in Go that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage users, feeds, and follow functionality. This tool provides commands for authentication, feed management, and aggregation.

## üöÄ Installation
Install the Gator CLI using the `go install` command:

```bash
go install github.com/your-username/gator@late
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Gator expects a configuration file named .gatorconfig.json located either in your home directory or as a fallback in the current project root.
‚úÖ Sample .gatorconfig.json:

{
  "DB_url": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable",
  "Current_user_name": "b"
}

Place this file at one of the following locations:

    $HOME/config.json

    ./config.json (project root)

Database Gator is required and can be setup by running make up with goose installed or manually running sql queries found in the schema folders
